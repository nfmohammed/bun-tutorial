- To download npm dependencies, we need to have a correct .npmrc file. 

- Since my global .npmrc is configure to download from my companies repository, I have added a local .npmrc file in this project to download dependencies from nodejs public repository. 

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.2.10. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
